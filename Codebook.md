##Description of the variables in the samsung.txt file

The output file (samsung.txt):

 - Contains summary data from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements for 30 subjects that were collected during 6 activity categories.

 - The 6 activities are: Walking, Walking upstairs, Walking downstairs, Sitting, Standing and Laying

 - For each subject / activity combination, data of 66 different accerlerometer parameters was collected 

 - For each subject / activity combination, at least 40 records of these 66 acceleromeasurements were obtained 

 - The output file lists, for each of the 66 accelerometer measurements, the mean value for each combination of subject / activity 

 - Variables present in the dataset:
